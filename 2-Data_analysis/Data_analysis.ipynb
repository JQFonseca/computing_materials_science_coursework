    "#### Measuring the distance between atoms using time of flight neutron diffraction\n",
    "\n",
    "For this coursework we will look at analysing some data from a time-of-flight neutron diffraction experiment on an aerospace aluminium alloy sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time-of-flight neutron diffraction uses neutrons to measure the distance between atoms. In this technique, a white neutron beam is shone on the sample and large detectors are used to collect the neutrons that are scattered off. The beam is \"white\" because it contains neutrons with many different velocities and hence different wavelengths. However not all wavelengths are scattered equally: those with wavelengths closer to regular spacing of the atoms in the crystal interfere constructively and scatter much more strongly. This means we can measure the distance between the atoms in the sample by counting how many neutrons are scattered of which wavelength. This is very useful in materials science: we can use this distance to measure the stress in a material, to measure its thermal expansion, to determine its structure and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [time-of-flight diffraction](http://nmi3.eu/neutron-research/techniques-for-/dynamics/time-of-flight-spectroscopy.html), we use the fact that neutrons with different wavelengths have different velocities, as described by the de Broglie equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p=mv=\\dfrac{h}{\\lambda}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p$ is momentum, $m$ is the mass of a neutron, $v$ its velocity and $\\lambda$ its wavelength.\n",
    "\n",
    "These velocities are not very high. For example, a neutron with a wavelength of $1 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$ has a velocity of:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v=\\dfrac{h}{\\lambda m}=\\dfrac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34}}{1.0\\times 10^{-9}\\times 1.675 \\times 10^{-27}} = 395.6 \\quad \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "which just over the speed of sound. In a time-of-flight experiment we send out neutrons in pulses and then count how many scattered neutrons arrive at different times. Of course since time can be converted into wavelength, it can be converted into the spacing between the atoms diffracting, also called the d-spacing.\n",

    "Neutrons are difficult to detect, so neutron detectors can be very big:\n",

    "Neutron counts are statistical measurements, which need to be analysed to give the required interatomic distances. In this coursework you'll be working with data from [ISIS](http://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/), a neutron source near Harwell in the UK. Each file contains the number of neutrons (intensity) detected that correspond to a given atomic spacing (d-spacing). You will use the data to determine the d-spacing of the material.\n"
